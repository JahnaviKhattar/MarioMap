# MarioMap

Ever wondered what it’d be like if Google Maps existed in Super Mario’s world?
Well… now you don’t have to! This little project brings that idea to life — a playful, pixel-perfect map styled after the classic Super Mario World 🎮✨

📌 What’s Inside:
🗺️ A map layout inspired by the Super Mario World overworld, complete with retro vibes and that nostalgic color palette.

🎨 Custom SVG icons and shapes — Yoshi's House , Ghost House , Castle etc

🐢 A clean, pixel-based grid layout with interactive zones you can click, hover, and play around with.

🏁 Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GoogleMaps API and SVG graphics — no game engines, just pure front-end fun!
